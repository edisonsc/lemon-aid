Yandex by Practicum  International October Code Jam

Team Lemonade

The **International October Practicum Code Jam** aims to draw participants' attention to the challenges we face in a new reality and jointly come up with digital solutions to address them.

Over the past 1,5 years, our daily lives have been profoundly changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first shock of the crisis has passed but we are still adapting.

We challenge you to create an MVP of a digital service that we can benefit from as lockdowns,  travel regulations, changing workplace habits, and health precautions are still affecting our lives. You can come up with your own project or use one of the ideas that we've drafted to inspire you.

**Lemon-aid**
Lemon-aid is a social platform designed to connect people who have suffered from COVID-19 with others who are interested in offering conversation and cheer. Users can access the "Ready to Help" platform to view profiles of people looking for help.
